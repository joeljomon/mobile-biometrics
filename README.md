# Biometrics

Evaluating a biometric systems performance through Detection Error Tradeoff Score and Receiver Operating Characteristic

Comparing the different systems (A, B, and C) has factors which would include the Dprime values, the Equal Error Rate and how the DET and ROC curves look as well. Biometric systems that have a high D-prime value and low EER rate indicate the separation between genuine and imposter scores and shows which have the better overall accuracy. In terms of the DET and ROC curves, the variations between these systems can suggest differences in how well each system separates the two distributions. For example, if there is one system
with a lot of overlap between the genuine and imposter scores, it would means that they have higher FPR and FNR rates across the thresholds, which would mean that the curves would have more variations and less performances.
